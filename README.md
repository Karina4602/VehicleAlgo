# Project3_VehicileAlgo

By: Karina Cabrera
Purpose: Originally a class project to demonstrate conceptual knowledge of Adjacency lists and specific algorithms.

Description: 
A program that takes a set of vehicles(points) and its connectivity range from a text file and creates an adjacency list based on if the vehicles(points) are connected to each other. 
The user is then provided multiple options such as displaying adjacent vehicles(points) for a specific vehicle, moving a vehicle, 
and displaying a vehicle(point) reachable vertices(other vehicles) based on a specific algorithm(DFS, BFS, and MST) 

Things to note: 
The only thing not created by me in this project is the MST/Prims Algorithm code in V1, this was created by a partner and I wish to change it in the future however,
I did create the code required to convert the adjacency list into a matrix so the MST algorithm may work.
